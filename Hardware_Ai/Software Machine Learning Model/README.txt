The library used for machine learning is Keras.
The neural network implemented is MLP.
The accuracy is about 95%
Some feature extraction have been implemented from the raw data.
The expected raw data has the format [ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz], where a stands for accelerometer, and g stands for gyroscope
